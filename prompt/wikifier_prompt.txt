You will be given two inputs:

1. text  — the full passage to analyze  
2. types — one or more lines in the form  
       Entity: label1, label2, label3, …

Your task:
• For each Entity in types pick exactly one label from its candidate list that best matches the overall theme of text.  
• If none of the labels apply for a given Entity, skip that line entirely.  
• Output one line per chosen entity, in the exact format:
      
      Entity->Label

• Do not output anything else—no quotes, no extra words, no punctuation beyond the arrow.

Example:

text 
World War I was a global conflict …

types 
World War I: SocietalEvent, Event, MilitaryConflict  
Archduke Franz Ferdinand: Person, Animal, Royalty  
Berlin: Place, Location, PopulatedPlace, City, Settlement
