For the Middle East, David Fromkin, A Peace to End All Peace (London, 2005) has been deservedly a bestseller, but there are two older books that make for thought:Walter Laqueur, A History of Zionism (New York, 2003) and Elie Kedourie, England and the Middle East: The Destruction of the Ottoman Empire. For the upshot in Germany, Samuel Halperin, Germany Tried Democracy (rep. New York, 1965) is a journalist’s very well informed account, though it should be read together with H. A. Winkler, Weimar 1918–1933 (Munich, 1999). On the catastrophe of the interwar period, the first hundred or so pages of A. J. P. Taylor’s Origins of the Second World War (London, 1963, with ‘second thoughts’) sum up the enormous gap between aspiration and reality. The same conclusion comes, very entertainingly, through Malcolm Muggeridge, The Thirties (written in 1939). Finally some works of fiction. The generation of 1914 was highly literate, and wrote more and better than that of 1939. The novels that I should put at the top of my own list are Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Voyage au bout de la nuit, C. S. Forrester, The General, Sebastian Faulks, Birdsong and, most recent, Louis de Bernieres, Birds Without Wings. The compliment in all cases is that I read them without stopping.
