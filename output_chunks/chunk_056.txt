I: To Arms (Oxford, 2001) is the first of three proposed volumes, and the author knows the military inside-out:he also covers the first months of the Ottoman war effort. I have owed much to all three of these books. There are several other shorter accounts, each with its strong point. Robin Prior and Trevor Wilson, The First World War (Cassell, 2001) is very useful on military technicalities, for instance the changes in artillery usage that occurred. They are not respectful of A. J. P. Taylor’s short The First World War (1966, but endlessly reprinted by Penguin). I am. For the eastern front, I am told in Moscow that an official history will at last appear in 2014. Italy is well covered – excellent photographs and a solid bibliographical discussion – in Mario Isnenghi and Giorgio Rochat, La Grande Guerra 1914–1918 (Milan, 2004), Austria-Hungary by Manfred Rauchensteiner, Der Tod des Doppeladlers (Graz, 1993); the most recent work on France is Anthony Clayton, Paths of Glory: The French Army 1914–1918 (London, 2005), though see also J.-B. Duroselle, La Grande Guerre des Français (Paris, 1994). The Turkish front is covered by Edward J.Erickson, Ordered to Die (Westport, Conn., 2000) but see also Michael Carver, The Turkish Front (London, 2001), though Commandant Larcher, La Guerre turque dans la guerre mondiale (Paris, 1926) still needs to be read. For Germany, G. Hirschfeld (ed.), Enzyklopädie Erster Weltkrieg (Munich, 2003) is useful, and there are summaries of important matters, given that some of the documentation disappeared; see also Holger Herwig, The First World War: Germany and Austria-Hungary 1914–1918 (London, 1997). I have used these as the basis for my narrative. However, it is now easily possible to supplement the basic accounts with a vast amount of research on the internet. A Google search on any name or topic usually brings remarkable results, the more so as many museums have their own websites. The Imperial War Museum in London is representative, and remarkable (www.iwm.org.uk), but there are many private websites, such as www.worldwar1.com, www.grande-guerre.org, or www.firstworldwar.com, and I have traced many biographies through others, such as www.findagrave.com. There are equivalents in other countries, but the British – or at any rate the ‘Anglo-Saxons’ – are far in the lead. As further reading (and sources) in connection with my own chapters, the following (complementary to the works mentioned above) may be cited:

Chapter 1: the most recent book is David Fromkin, Europe’s Last Summer: Who Started the War in 1914? (New York, 2004), with a decent booklist. James Joll, The Origins of the First World War (Longman, 1992) still remains important, and, for the background, so does A. J. P. Taylor: The Struggle for Mastery in Europe 1848–1918 (Oxford, 1954). It was written at a time when the crisis of July 1914 could still be seen as the outcome of a series of diplomatic crises, and these (Morocco etc.) are superbly covered, though Taylor was inclined to see July 1914 as a product of ‘the system’ rather than of plotting in Berlin. Imanuel Geiss, Die Juli-Krise 1914 (2 vols., Munich, 1964), with an abridged English edition, July 1914 (London, 1967) did document the outbreak of the war as a mise-en-scène, and further corroborative evidence, from papers that had escaped destruction, then began to emerge:see Angela Mombauer, Origins of the First World War (Harlow, 2002). Geiss subverted the important myth that Russian mobilization prompted German; see also V. Berghahn, Germany and the Approach of War in 1914 (Basingstoke, 1995):his advantage is that he understands the dimension of the navy. Chapter 2: on the opening round, L. Burchardt, Friedenswirtschaft und Kriegsvorsorge (Boppard, 1968) and L. J. Farrar, The Short-war Illusion (Santa Barbara, 1973) variously discuss this important matter. Winston Churchill’s World Crisis (6 vols., London 1923–31) is wonderfully dramatic on the Marne, and so is John Keegan, The First World War (London 1998). D. E. Showalter, Tannenberg (Hamden, Conn., 1991) deserves mention. Chapter 3: Tim Travers, The Killing Ground (Barnsley, 2003) is an important study of the British army’s ‘learning curve’. Robert Graves, Goodbye to All That (London, 1960) is a classic disillusioned account of the ‘New Army’ as it started off in France, and compare Barry Webb, Edmund Blunden (London, 1990) for a more resigned view. Another classic British observer was E. L. Spears, liaison officer with the French (in both world wars), and his life is excellently recorded by Max Egremont, Under Two Flags (London, 1997). For Italian intervention, Indro Montanelli, L’Italia di Giolitti (Rizzoli, 1975) is wonderfully readable and given to the black humour that modern Italy sometimes brings out. On the Dardanelles campaign, Nigel Steel and Peter Hart, Defeat at Gallipoli (London, 2002) and Tim Travers, Gallipoli 1915 (London, 2001) are solid and very fair-minded.
