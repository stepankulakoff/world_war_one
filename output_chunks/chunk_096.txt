Taylor’s Origins of the Second World War (London, 1963, with ‘second thoughts’) sum up the enormous gap between aspiration and reality. The same conclusion comes, very entertainingly, through Malcolm Muggeridge, The Thirties (written in 1939). Finally some works of fiction. The generation of 1914 was highly literate, and wrote more and better than that of 1939. The novels that I should put at the top of my own list are Louis-Ferdinand Céline, Voyage au bout de la nuit, C. S. Forrester, The General, Sebastian Faulks, Birdsong and, most recent, Louis de Bernieres, Birds Without Wings. The compliment in all cases is that I read them without stopping.
